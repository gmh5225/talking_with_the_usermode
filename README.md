# talking_with_the_usermode

Example on how a Windows Driver and a usermode application can communicate following the Rings Tutorial. <br>
Currently the Driver is able to take IOCTL Requests from the usermode application. <br> 
The driver can provide the usermode application a base address of a module, a pid to the process the module is loaded in, read/write operations to/from memory and protect a given pid from being terminated/read (from).
PreOpenProcessOperation strips any newly created handle to the protected process from its (PROCESS_TERMINATE), PROCESS_DUP_HANDLE, PROCESS_VM_READ and PROCESS_VM_OPERATION rights. When OpenProcess is called and a Handle to the protected program is created the Callback interferes.


#### Important CLI commands mentioned in [Nidhogg Repo](https://github.com/Idov31/Nidhogg) to start the driver.

##### Driver Testing

To test it in your testing environment run those commands with elevated cmd:

```cmd
bcdedit /set testsigning on
```

After rebooting, create a service and run the driver:

```cmd
sc create drivername type= kernel binPath= C:\Path\To\Driver\drivername.sys
sc start drivername
```

##### Debugging

To debug the driver in your testing environment run this command with elevated cmd and reboot your computer:

```cmd
bcdedit /debug on
```

After the reboot, you can see the debugging messages in tools such as WinDBG WDK Tool.
